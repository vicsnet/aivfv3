# AIVF: IVF Support & Management Platform

AIVF is a full-stack SaaS application designed to support women undergoing IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) treatment. The IVF process is complex, emotionally taxing, and requires strict adherence to medication schedules. AIVF aims to empower patients and clinics with tools to track, remind, and support every step of the journey.

- **Personalized injection reminders**
- **Emergency alert system**
